# 03 — Roadmap

Every milestone ends with something you can run and show, and each retires
the scariest remaining unknown first. A milestone's "out" list is as binding
as its "in" list. Calibration: RoboCAD went from empty to 58k lines in three
weeks; this roadmap is smaller than that.

Spine: M0 → M1 → M2 → M3 → M4, then v0.2.

---

## M0 — Skeleton and the ported viewport

*Goal: `riggen part.stl` opens a window with the part in it.*

**Status: done 2026-08-29, tag `m0`.**

- Workspace of 01-architecture; CI (fmt, clippy, test, wasm build check).
- `riggen-mesh`: `TriMesh`, STL (binary + ASCII) and OBJ loaders, AABB,
  ray/triangle.
- `riggen-viewport` ported from `robocad-viewport`: cgmath → glam, `BodyId`
  → `InstanceId`, `RenderMesh` → `TriMesh`, `TopoRef` → `PickHit
  (InstanceId, triangle)`, sketch-plane code, edge/vertex pick passes and
  the face-outline pass removed. Camera, low-latency surface config,
  whole-instance hover/select restyle, axes triad, gradient background,
  zoom-to-fit kept. (robocad never had a ground grid or MSAA; both are
  backlog items, not ports.)
- `riggen-app`: eframe shell, CLI args, file drop and `rfd` open, one
  instance per dropped file, File › Open/Quit menu, status bar with
  frame-time HUD.
- `egui_kittest` snapshot harness and `debug_state()` from day one.

**Out:** any document; any panel beyond the status bar and the File menu.

**Accept:** drop three STLs → three orbitable, pickable parts; the
`startup`, `cube`, `hover_cube`, `select_cube`, `three_parts` snapshot
scenarios pass on the CPU adapter; wasm target builds.

## M1 — Document, tree, joints, FK

*Goal: a two-link pendulum you can save, reopen, and swing.*

**Status: done 2026-08-29, tag `m1`.** Decisions: ADR-0005 (ids, joints as
edges), ADR-0006 (drops, removal, import scale).

- `riggen-core`: types of 02-data-model, `validate`, `fk`, snapshot
  `History`, `.riggen` v1 serde with relative mesh paths and content hash.
- Link tree panel (add/remove/rename/reparent by drag), properties panel
  with numeric pose entry (xyz + RPY, editable in degrees, stored in radians),
  joint creation between selected links, joint sliders window driving FK.
- Materials table with density; per-link material choice.
- New/Open/Save/Save As with dirty marker and confirm; undo/redo shortcuts
  (the RoboCAD egui `consume_key` ordering lesson applies verbatim).

**Out:** gizmos, snapping, inertials, export.

**Accept:** build a base + arm from two STLs with a revolute joint typed
numerically; the slider swings it within limits; save, reopen, undo/redo
survive; `fk` unit tests against hand-computed poses for a 3-joint chain.

## M2 — Placement UX (the risk milestone)

*Goal: assemble a 3-DoF arm from a folder of STLs using only the mouse, in
under five minutes, without typing a coordinate.*

**Status: done 2026-08-29, tag `m2`.** The risk — a circle fit good enough
to place a joint from one click on STL data with no B-Rep — came out
cheaper than feared; the method is 02-data-model §Mesh features. Decisions:
ADR-0007 (the gizmo from `transform-gizmo-egui`, bridged through `mint`),
amended by ADR-0010 (its egui glue is ours, the pointer shared per handle).
The by-hand exit gate came back "generally fine" with nine backlog lines;
eight remain.

- `transform-gizmo-egui` on a link (its parent joint's origin; the subtree
  follows) or on a joint (its pivot, the geometry staying put); drag =
  preview, release = one command. A geom's own pose stayed
  properties-panel-only.
- Snapping: pick-point, triangle-vertex, AABB corners/centers, face normal,
  behind the Place joint and Align tools.
- **Circle fit from a picked triangle fan** → joint axis and origin from a
  bore or shaft in one click; a visible confidence readout (residual, number
  of segments) so a bad fit is obvious.
- Joint glyphs in the overlay: axis line, limit arc, origin triad; hover a
  joint in the tree → highlight it in 3D and vice versa.
- Align: two clicks bring a part exported out of place onto a feature, as
  one `SetJoint` through `fk::origin_for_world`. Reparenting stayed the
  tree drag it was in M1 — the gizmo moves a link *within* its parent, and
  the two gestures turned out not to want the same handle.
- Snapshot tests for every gizmo/glyph state; iterate on this milestone with
  the snapshots open, not after.

**Out:** inertials, export.

**Accept:** the five-minute arm, recorded as a scripted `egui_kittest`
scenario that replays the clicks and asserts the resulting joint axes
within 1 mm / 0.5°. A human does it once for real and reports what was
annoying; that list is the M2 exit gate.

## M3 — Sim-ready: inertials, collision, export, import

*Goal: the exported MJCF loads in MuJoCo with zero warnings and moves like
the viewport does.*

- Mass properties ported from `robocad-kernel/src/mass.rs`; `compose_inertial`;
  `InertialSpec` modes and the comparison readout; closed-mesh detection.
- `CollisionPolicy`: convex hull (`riggen-mesh::hull`, quickhull), fitted
  box/cylinder/sphere/capsule, translucent collision view.
- `ResolvedRobot`; MJCF writer; URDF writer; export dialog with mesh path
  style; validation errors block export with the reason.
- URDF import via `urdf-rs`; `riggen robot.urdf` on the command line.
- Round-trip FK test in CI; MuJoCo load test in CI (Python job).
- Sample robot in `assets/` used by the tests and the README screenshot.

**Status: done 2026-08-29, tag `m3`.** The risk — MuJoCo loading our MJCF
with zero compiler warnings and agreeing with `fk` — was retired at step 5
and held through the URDF import; the `mujoco` CI job runs both arms.
Decisions: ADR-0008 (export conventions). The `mujoco.viewer` look is still
the human's; the exit gate's findings are an M3 heading in the backlog.

**Out:** convex decomposition, actuators, MJCF import.

**Accept:** the sample arm exports; `mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path` succeeds
with no compiler warnings and `mj_forward` body poses match `fk` to 1e-6;
`urdf-rs` round-trip passes; importing a Menagerie-style URDF and
re-exporting it as MJCF loads too.

## M4 — Distribution

*Goal: `uv add riggen && riggen` on a machine that has never seen Rust.*

- `python/pyproject.toml` with maturin `bindings = "bin"`; `python -m riggen`.
- CI wheels for linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS arm64/x86_64, Windows x86_64;
  `uv build` locally; TestPyPI first, then PyPI. Reserve the crates.io name
  with a placeholder publish of `riggen-core`.
- README with a 30-second screencast, install line, and the sample robot;
  `--help`; a `--version` that prints the git hash.
- Startup time budget: window visible in < 500 ms on the dev machine, measured
  and asserted in a test.

**Status: done 2026-08-30, tag `m4`.** The risk — a wheel from this
workspace that installs and runs on a clean venv — was retired at step 1
and held through the container matrix. Decisions: ADR-0002, amended by
ADR-0009 (one wheel: the abi3 extension plus the binary as data); the
layout is 01-architecture §Python distribution.

Two measurements this file is the only record of. **Startup** on the dev
machine (RTX 5090, X11): `RiggenApp::new` to the first frame 8 ms — the
part the budget test pins — and launch to the first frame 380–500 ms, of
which ~200 ms is NVIDIA's Vulkan device creation and the rest the X11
window. **Wheels** at `v0.2.0`: linux x86_64 9.7 MB, linux aarch64 9.2,
macOS arm64 6.2, macOS x86_64 6.6, Windows 7.4, sdist 0.3; the abi3
extension is 1.3 MB of that.

PyPI's CDN can serve the previous version for some minutes after an
upload, so a `pip install` straight after a release may lag. The clean-VM
window run is still the human's; the exit gate's findings are an M4
heading in the backlog.

**Accept:** a clean VM installs the wheel and opens the sample arm; the
release workflow is a tag push.

## v0.2 — Python SDK and the harder mesh work

**Status: in progress.** Done so far:

- **2026-08-30, tag `v0.2.0`** — the Python SDK (ADR-0009): `import
  riggen` beside the app in one wheel, `python/riggen/` the API over the
  `riggen._riggen` extension. 01-architecture §Python distribution and
  §Python SDK have the shape; the by-hand notebook run passed.
- **2026-08-30** — the viewport pointer (ADR-0010): with Move or Rotate
  active the viewport orbits, pans, zooms, tints and selects as it does
  with no tool, everywhere but on a gizmo handle. Closed the M2 exit
  gate's largest line.

Still open:

- Convex decomposition (CoACD port or a bundled binary — decide with an ADR).
- Named frames / MJCF sites; mimic joints; actuator presets.
- MJCF import; SDF export.
- Web demo build if the wasm check has stayed green.

## What not to spend agent time on

Physics, collision checking, parametric primitives, docking UI, a second
renderer, USD, or theming. Re-open any of these only through an ADR.
